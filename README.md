# Conda Communications

This repo is the GitHub home of the [conda communications team](https://github.com/orgs/conda/teams/communications).

The Communications team helps to improve the communication between the conda organization and the larger conda community and works in tandem with the steering council and projects under the conda governance policy.

## Responsibilities

We are responsible for helping with communication efforts and to help project maintainers and other conda organization members if/when they need help with communication topics (e.g. release announcements).

This includes

* maintenance of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/condaproject), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@conda) and related social media presence
* co-administration and moderation of conda community spaces such as the [conda Community Forum](https://conda.discourse.group/), and the [conda chat space](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda:matrix.org)
* co-administration of mailing lists under the conda.org domain
* [website maintenance (conda.org)](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-dot-org)

## Team communications

First, **if you want to join the communications team, then we want you to join communications team!**

Most team communication happens in the [Conda Comms Element/Matrix channel](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-comms:matrix.org).  Anyone can join and participate.

## Governance and Code of Conduct

We are governed by the **[conda Organization Governance policies](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance)** and the **[Communications Team Governance](GOVERNANCE.md)** policies.

All team interactions, and all conda spaces, follow the **[conda Organization Code of Conduct](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

The conda communications team was [created in December 2022](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/issues/81) by the conda Steering Council.

# Conda Communications Team Governance

**We are governed by the [conda Organization Governance policies](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance) and the policies lad out below.  All team interactions, and all conda spaces, follow the [conda Organization Code of Conduct](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**

The communications team has a [dyanmic charter](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/README.md#dynamic-charter), meaning that we are laregely self-organizing, and we control team membership (with the caveat that we must have at least one Steering Council member on the team.)

## Voting and Decision Making

We have a [GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/conda/teams/communications) that lists the *formal* members of the team.  However, most decisions will be made *informally*, either in the [Conda Comms chat channel](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-comms:matrix.org) or in [issues in this repo](https://github.com/conda/communications/issues).

If any member of the [GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/conda/teams/communications) feels that an issue merits a formal vote, then they can call a formal vote on that issue. In this case a tally will be kept, and only members of the GitHub team can vote.

There is also one decision that *requires* a formal vote and that is **Adding members to, or dropping members from the [GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/conda/teams/communications).**  See [this section of the conda governance document](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/README.md#nominate-new-member-of-a-community-project-team) for process and policies. Note that members can drop themselves at any time.

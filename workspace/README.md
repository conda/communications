# Conda Communications Workspace Directory

This is the workspace / sandbox / staging directory for the [conda communications team](https://github.com/orgs/conda/teams/communications) when it wants to collaboratively create content that will be published elsewhere, such as on the community website, or on the community's forum.  This is particularly good for working on things in Markdown, which is used by both of those sites.

## Practices

These are proposals, which may eventually evolve into guidelines, or not.  Either way this is a sandbox.  Worry more about the content than the rules.

### File Naming

In this directory, name your files

  ``YYYY-MM-something-descriptive``

Include the appropriate extension too.

### Header information

At the top of each file include some information about the post, such as why, where it will be posted, and when.

### Cleanup ?

See issue #3 for discussion.

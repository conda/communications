# Content

The conda community will be at [PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/) this April, including a tutorial and a talk, plus two (we hope!) participatory events as well. Here's what's happening:

## [Publishing your Python project, the conda way](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/94/)

* **Tutorial**
* **Thursday, April 20, 09:00-12:30**
* **[Dave Clements](https://us.pycon.org/2023/speaker/profile/108/), [Valerio Maggio](https://us.pycon.org/2023/speaker/profile/109/), [Mahe Iram Khan](https://us.pycon.org/2023/speaker/profile/166/)**

Learn how to create a full-fledged and easy to install Python software package using conda and [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).

To participate you will need to register in advance for this tutorial.

## [Plug life into your codebase: Making an established Python codebase pluggable](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/66/)

* **Talk**
* **Saturday, April 22, 11:30-12:00**
* **[Bianca Henderson](https://us.pycon.org/2023/speaker/profile/75/)**

Learn about the [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) Python framework and how it is being used in conda to make it plugin-friendly. Functionalities such as authentication and authorization, Different storage backends (e.g., S3 buckets, etc.), development environment integrations (e.g., different shells), programming language support, and code editor integrations are all possible to implement via a plugin system.

## Conda and conda-forge community booth (maybe)

* **Thursday-Saturday, April 20-22**

We have applied for a [PyCon Community Booth](https://us.pycon.org/2023/expo/expo-hall/) where conference participants can drop by and learn more about conda-forge and the rest of the conda ecosystem.  This booth, **if approved**, will be open [whenever the Expo Hall is open](https://us.pycon.org/2023/expo/expo-hall/).

We will update this post when we know our fate. If you are interested in helping with the booth then [please add your information here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xAmxR5znO9D1tEPjdLRG1qh5ZhSuH2EPEWCWwAwe4yo/edit#gid=0) and join the [Conda PyCon US 2023 Matrix channel](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-pycon-us-2023:matrix.org).  We'll be in touch with you as the event gets closer.

## Conda and Friends sprint

* **Monday-Tuesday, April 24-25**

The conda community will be participating in the first two days of [PyCon sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/sprints/).

Sprints are collaborative work events where we expand and improve the conda community and ecosystem.  Sprints are about contributing and *learning how to contribute* to all aspects of the conda ecosystem, including tools, plugins, training material, documentation, community infrastructure unit tests, bug reports, and even code. If you care about the conda ecosystem then we would love to have you here, no matter what you can contribute.

The larger packaging community will also be there, making this an opportunity to improve the conda ecosystem's interoperability with the rest of the Python packaging ecosystem.

If you are interested then please join us in Salt Lake, and on the [Conda PyCon US 2023 Matrix channel](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-pycon-us-2023:matrix.org).

PyCon sprints are free and will be held at the same location as the conference.

## Other packaging related content

PyCon has tons of other things going on and some of them are particularly relevant to the conda and packaging communities.  These include talks about [Sigstore](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/19/), [`pyproject.toml`](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/42/), and [Briefcase](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/20/).  There's also [another tutorial](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/2/) that is using conda, but isn't about conda per se.

We will update this post as we find out more, and we hope to see you in Salt Lake!

Dave C.

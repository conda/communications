## Have you had a community booth at PyCon US before?

* Unknown
* Yes
* **No**

DC: I really want to say no.  Does anyone know if either organization has had a booth at PyCon before?


## Organization type

What type of organization or project are you - nonprofit, independent open source project, other?

* **Non-profit**
* Independent open source project
* Other

We are both part of NumFOCUS which is a non-profit, but the project's themselves are not non-profits.

DC: I say we go with Non-Profit.


## Project description

If you are an open source project, please share a short description of your project in 1-3 sentences (You may want to tell us how Python is involved in your project, what the purpose of your project is, how long has your project existed?). Please also share a GitHub url.

There is no specific character limit.

### Description 1

`conda-forge (https://conda-forge.org/) is a widely used package repository in the Python ecosystem that is built on the conda packaging ecosystem. The conda ecosystem (https://conda.io/) supports package and run-time environment management on multiple operating systems (including Linux, Windows, and macOS), and supports packages written in any programming language (or even in multiple languages).`

DC: Note the use of conda.io instead of conda.org.  conda.org would be better, but it likely won't be up by the time the booth aplications are reviewed.

### Description 2

`conda and conda-forge support open source package management that works across multiple operating systems and supports packages implemented in any (or multiple) programming language(s).  conda-forge (https://conda-forge.org/) is a widely used conda-compatible repository with over 20,00 packages, most of them written in Python.  The conda ecosystem (https://conda.io) is a set of tools and repositories that make package and run-time environment management accessible to over 30 million users.`

### Description 3

`Your idea here`


## Booth use

In 1-3 sentences, can you tell us how you hope to use your booth and/or what benefits you hope to get out of having your booth at PyCon US?

### Proposal 1

`We hope to increase awareness of the conda-forge repository and the rest of the conda ecosystem. We also plan to answer questions from users and potential users, and to communicate conda's status as an open source, NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project.`

### Proposal 2

`Your idea here.`

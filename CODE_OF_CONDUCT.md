If you notice [any behavior](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#the-short-version) that does not live up to our Code of Conduct then you are strongly encouraged to [reach out](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#report-an-incident) to the Code of Conduct Committee.
